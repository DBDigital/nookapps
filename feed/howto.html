<h3>How to configure your nook to install apps</h3>
<p>You'll need to allow your nook to install 3rd party applications
to install any of these apps here.</p>

<p>YMMV, but what I've done is to get an <tt>adb</tt> shell on
the nook -- and if you're reading this, you probably have figured
out how to do it already! Then, I run (lines broken for readability)</p>

<pre>
# cd /data/data/
        com.android.providers.settings/databases
# sqlite3 settings.db
</pre>
<p>Here, you'll find a table called <tt>secure</tt>, and you need
to update this table and set <tt>install_non_market_apps</tt> to
<tt>1</tt>. Something like</p>
<pre>
update secure set value=1
  where name='install_non_market_apps';
</pre>

<p>ought to do it.</p>
