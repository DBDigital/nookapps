Trook is an application for the Nook that can download books from [Stanza catalogs](http://www.lexcycle.com) or [OPDS content](http://code.google.com/p/openpub/). It can also read RSS or ATOM feeds, show associated web pages or download audio files from such feeds. In addition, it lets you browse your Nook's document folders. With catalogs generated by [calibre2opds](http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Calibre2opds), it can also navigate your [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) managed book collection by tags, authors, titles and more. Or, you can just organize your books in folders on the nook, and trook will preserve folders, show cover images and so on. Finally, it can also install more applications, if they are linked from a feed.

Here's [a discussion forum for Trook](http://groups.google.com/group/trookhub) where you can discuss enhancements, ideas, bugs and workarounds. You may also find [the Trook documentation](http://code.google.com/p/nookapps/wiki/TrookDocumentation) wiki helpful, particularly for the more obscure features in Trook.


By default, Trook works only over the wifi network. From rev53 onwards, if you have [replaced your sim card](http://nookdevs.com/What_we_know#Using_International_SIM_Card) to permit general 3G/GPRS access, you can enable a setting to let Trook use 3G/GPRS as well. You will also have to find a way to allow you to install applications onto the Nook, and for this, let me point you to the wonderful folks at [Nookdevs](http://www.nookdevs.com), whose efforts made it possible for me to write this application in the first place.

From rev68 onwards, Trook is able to read Calibre catalogs generated by [calibre2opds](http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Calibre2opds), and many thanks to David Pierron for making this possible. With [calibre2opds](http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Calibre2opds), you can now export your books and blurbs from Calibre directly onto the nook, and also navigate them very efficiently by tags, titles, authors and so on. Here's a look at how a Calibre2OPDS catalog looks like on my collection of a few hundred books.

Here's a look at other things trook can do. I browse around the lexcycle catalog and download a book, then read something from the New York times feed, download a podcast from PRI, and finally install a browser application onto the Nook.

This one shows how you can search Stanza/OPDS catalogs and download books.

Here's a clip of how you browse the documents on your Nook.

You can also access your [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) content server to browse/download books. This video also shows how you bookmark a feed so you can conveniently access it later on.

### Bleeding edge projects ###
[![](http://nookapps.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/nookletcontainer/res/drawable/nooklet_icon.png)](http://code.google.com/p/nookapps/wiki/Nooklets)

Over a couple of weekends, I've put together a small framework to write applications for the Nook in html and javascript, along with some samples. If html/javascript development is your cup of tea (or you just want to run the sample sudoku nooklet) [check out Nooklets](http://code.google.com/p/nookapps/wiki/Nooklets).

Many thanks to [klaymen](http://odbloc.info) for the cute Nooklet icon!
