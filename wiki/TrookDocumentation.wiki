= Using Trook =

I hope you find the application generally straightforward to use; but there
are a few things that will undoubtedly stymie you, so here's the scoop on
some of this.

To change the default feed root, tap on the little gear looking icon on
the title bar, and you can enter the path to a feed of your own choice.

If you change your mind and want to reset the feed to whatever comes
by default -- please go back to the feed entry dialog, and submit an
empty text box, which will cause it to start using the default feed.

The application offers no feed management per-se, so you will probably find it best
to use an online feed aggregator to manage your feeds, and point Trook to
the aggregated feed. It is probably best to create Atom feeds, although Trook
does make attempts to understand RSS feeds as well.

Please keep in mind that you can always link to other feeds from your feed [that's how
the hierarchies are actually done.] If you want to point  back to the default feed from
your own feed, please use this URI `asset:default_root_feed.xml`

For example, if you were creating your own Atom feed, you'd add a section like
this:
{{{
  <entry>
    <title>Default Trook catalog</title>
    <link type="application/atom+xml" href="asset:default_root_feed.xml"/>
    <id>asset:default_root_feed.xml</id>
    <content type="text">Trook's default catalog</content>
  </entry>
}}}

Trook understands Stanza catalogs, so in principle (can someone verify
this?) you should be able to access your Calibre-managed books from the Nook,
once you enable Calibre's server, and you have a way to access that server over
the internet.
