==How do I load a feed of my choice?==

Tap on the little gear looking icon on the title bar, and you can enter
the path to a feed of your own choice. It's painful to enter text, I know.
I'm sorry about that.

==How do I change the startup feed?==

There are two ways to do this.

===Save a feed locally as your startup feed===

Tap on the gear icon to enter a feed from the network. Once it loads
successfully, long click on the gear icon (2-3 seconds.) This will open
up a menu, and you can tap on the "Save this feed as the default" choice.

Please note that this will actually download the file locally, and it will
become the static, startup feed. If you want to refresh it, you'll have to
go through the same process again.

The new feed root will be used when the application is next restarted.
To stop the application, bring up the menu using the long click on the
gear icon, and the bottom has a "Stop application" command.


Alternatively, you could creating a static feed of feeds and
copy it over USB, so you can refresh individual feeds on demand.

=== Copy a static file over USB ===

It's best to create an Atom style feed (please use
[http://code.google.com/p/nookapps/source/browse/trunk/trook/assets/default_root_feed.xml  the default feed file] as an example.)

Please validate this carefully, otherwise the application will fail on
startup. You still recover the app, but you'll need to reconnect your
nook over usb to fix it, which can be needlessly painful.

Connect your Nook over usb, and create a folder called <tt>/my feeds</tt>
if it doesn't already exist. Then, copy your xml file as
<tt>/my feeds/root.xml</tt>

=== Reset the default feed ===
If anything should go wrong, if you can see the gear icon at least, bring
up the long click menu on it, and select the "Restore default feed" entry.
Bring the menu up again, and stop the application. Restarting it should
bring up the default feeds again.

=== What sort of Atom feed is this? ===
Trook intends to implement some random subset of [http://code.google.com/p/openpub/wiki/OPDS OPDS] but your best bet is to look at [http://code.google.com/p/nookapps/source/browse/trunk/trook/assets/default_root_feed.xml the default feed file] and the
[http://www.lexcycle.com/developer Stanza catalog format documentation] from Lexcycle.

At it's core, it's just a set of feeds, that can point to other feeds (thus giving hierarchies) epub files, audio files or (and this is special to Trook) android apk files.

By the way, should you ever feel the desire to point to the default feed from your
own feed, there's a magic URI `asset:default_root_feed.xml`

For example, if you were creating your own Atom feed, you'd add a section like
this:
{{{
  <entry>
    <title>Default Trook catalog</title>
    <link type="application/atom+xml" href="asset:default_root_feed.xml"/>
    <id>asset:default_root_feed.xml</id>
    <content type="text">Trook's default catalog</content>
  </entry>
}}}

As Trook understands Stanza catalogs, it should be able to access your [http://calibre-ebook.com/ Calibre] managed book collection once you run the Calibre server, and have a way to connect to it over the network (thanks for confirming this [http://code.google.com/u/sethcohn/ sethcon] -- please see his comments below.)
