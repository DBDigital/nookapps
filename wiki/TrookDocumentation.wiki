==How do I load a feed of my choice?==

Tap on the little gear looking icon on the title bar, and enter the URL to the feed you want to load.

==How do I bookmark this feed?==

Long-click on the gear icon, and you'll find a menu that lets you bookmark the current URL. The bookmark will go into your "my feeds" area, which is accessible from the Trook root screen.
By the way, a bookmark is just a text file with the suffix <pre>.bookmark</pre> so feel free to create more bookmarks and upload them through USB.

==Can I browse my locally stored books?==

The "my books" entry from the Trook root menu lets you browse your documents, and preserves any folder structure you have there.

==How can I add or change the cover art for my book?==

Just create an image with the same name as the book (but change
the suffix as appropriate.) For example, if you have an epub book
in <pre>my documents/Adventure/Professor Challenger.epub</pre>
create an image called <pre>my documents/Adventure/Professor Challenger.jpg</pre> You can create jpg, png or gif files.

==Can I search a catalog?==

If a catalog provides a search option, you'll see a magnifying glass icon
appear next to the settings. Click on it to search the current catalog.

==Can I access my Calibre catalog?==

Yes -- start up your calibre server, and load the feed <pre>http://server-ip:8080/stanza</pre> You can also bookmark it to "my feeds" so it's conveniently accessible from then on. (Thanks to [http://code.google.com/u/sethcohn/ sethcon] for the tip.)

Also, please see [http://code.google.com/u/dpierron/ dpierron]'s pointer to his [http://davidsoft.free.fr/calibre2opds/calibre2opds/Welcome.html calibre2opds] system (see his comments below) for a way to extract and publish your stanza catalog/books to a service like [http://dropbox.com Dropbox], so you can access your catalog more easily on the internet.
 
==How do I change the startup menu?==

You can override the default menu -- it's just an atom feed -- by creating
an xml file called <pre>my feeds/root.xml</pre> It's best to start with
[http://code.google.com/p/nookapps/source/browse/trunk/trook/assets/default_root_feed.xml  the default feed file] and modify it as appropriate.

Mount the Nook over USB, and create a folder called <tt>/my feeds</tt>
if it doesn't already exist. Then, copy your xml file as
<tt>/my feeds/root.xml</tt>, and make sure that the file is world readable.

(If you are accessing your Nook through an <tt>adb shell</tt>
however, the root USB mountpoint is at <tt>/system/media/sdcard</tt>.)

=== Reset the default feed ===
If anything should go wrong, if you can see the gear icon at least, bring
up the long click menu on it, and select the "Restore default feed" entry.
Bring the menu up again, and stop the application. Restarting it should
bring up the default feeds again.

=== What sort of Atom feed is this? ===
Trook intends to implement some random subset of [http://code.google.com/p/openpub/wiki/OPDS OPDS] but your best bet is to look at [http://code.google.com/p/nookapps/source/browse/trunk/trook/assets/default_root_feed.xml the default feed file] and the
[http://www.lexcycle.com/developer Stanza catalog format documentation] from Lexcycle.

At its core, it's just a set of feeds, that can point to other feeds (thus giving hierarchies) or a list of epub files, audio files or (and this is special to Trook) android apk files.

By the way, should you ever feel the desire to point to the default feed from your
own feed, there's a magic URI `asset:default_root_feed.xml`

For example, if you were creating your own Atom feed, you'd add a section like
this:
{{{
  <entry>
    <title>Default Trook catalog</title>
    <link type="application/atom+xml" href="asset:default_root_feed.xml"/>
    <id>asset:default_root_feed.xml</id>
    <content type="text">Trook's default catalog</content>
  </entry>
}}}
