#summary Nooklets -- installing and running

= About Nooklets =

Nooklets are this crazy idea I had that it just might be feasible to develop reasonable Nook applications entirely in HTML and Javascript. I've cooked up a small system to do just this,  and a sample Sudoku application to go with it.

It's all still fairly new, so please have fun with it and don't expect too many great things :-)

= Installing =
Please download [http://nookapps.googlecode.com/files/nooklets.zip the sample nooklets] and unzip it to the root of your internal SD card from your PC. When it's over, you should find a folder called `nooklets/` at the root of your internal SD card.

Next, download and install [http://nookapps.googlecode.com/files/Nooklet-debug.apk the Nooklet container] as usual, and add it to your launcher. If it all goes well, you should find three sample applications.

= Writing nooklets =

Nooklets are just a couple of HTML files -- one for the eink, and one for the touch area. Take a look at the `Hello` application to see how easy it is to create an app. You might find the NookletSpecification helpful, in lieu of any other documentation at the moment (sorry!)

Have fun!
